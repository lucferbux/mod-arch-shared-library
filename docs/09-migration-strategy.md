# Migration Strategy

For organizations with existing monolithic applications, we recommend a phased migration approach that minimizes risk while maximizing value delivery. This document provides a comprehensive strategy for transitioning to modular architecture.

## Migration Philosophy

### Principles

- **Incremental Approach**: Migrate features incrementally rather than attempting a complete rewrite
- **Risk Minimization**: Each phase reduces risk while delivering value
- **Business Continuity**: Maintain business operations throughout the migration
- **Learning and Adaptation**: Learn from each phase and adapt the approach

### Success Criteria

- **No User Impact**: Users should not experience disruption during migration
- **Improved Developer Experience**: Each phase should improve developer productivity
- **Maintained Quality**: Quality and performance should be maintained or improved
- **Community Alignment**: Migration should align with upstream community practices

## Migration Phases

### Phase 1: Assessment and Planning

**Duration**: 2-4 weeks

**Objective**: Understand current state and plan migration approach

#### Activities

1. **Feature Audit**: Identify discrete features suitable for extraction

   - Map current application features and boundaries
   - Identify features with clear business domain boundaries
   - Assess feature complexity and dependencies
   - Prioritize features for migration based on business value and complexity

2. **Dependency Analysis**: Map current inter-feature dependencies

   - Document data flows between features
   - Identify shared components and utilities
   - Map API dependencies and integrations
   - Analyze authentication and authorization patterns

3. **API Definition**: Define clean API contracts for identified features

   - Create OpenAPI specifications for each feature's BFF
   - Define data models and request/response formats
   - Specify authentication and authorization requirements
   - Document error handling and edge cases

4. **Team Alignment**: Ensure team understanding and buy-in

   - Conduct architecture workshops with development teams
   - Align on technology standards and practices
   - Define roles and responsibilities for migration
   - Establish communication and coordination processes

#### Deliverables

- Feature inventory and migration priority matrix
- Dependency map and integration analysis
- API contract specifications for priority features
- Migration roadmap and timeline
- Team organization and responsibility matrix

### Phase 2: Foundation Setup with Shared Library

**Duration**: 3-6 weeks

**Objective**: Establish shared infrastructure, development standards, and the mod-arch-shared library

#### Activities

1. **Shared Library Creation** (`mod-arch-shared`): Establish the foundation library

   - **Component Extraction**: Extract reusable components from existing application
     ```bash
     # Extract components with dependency analysis
     npm run extract-components --analyze-dependencies
     
     # Create component library structure
     mkdir -p mod-arch-shared/src/components/{navigation,data-display,forms,feedback}
     ```
   
   - **Provider Architecture**: Implement provider-based state management
     ```typescript
     // Create core providers
     export { AppContextProvider } from './providers/app';
     export { ThemeProvider } from './providers/theme';
     export { UserProvider } from './providers/auth';
     export { NotificationProvider } from './providers/notifications';
     ```
   
   - **API Integration Layer**: Build unified API client infrastructure
     ```typescript
     // Implement type-safe API clients
     export { RestClient } from './api/rest';
     export { K8sClient } from './api/k8s';
     export { useApi, useK8sResource } from './hooks/api';
     ```
   
   - **Design System**: Establish consistent theming and styling
     ```scss
     // Create design tokens and theme system
     @import './tokens/colors';
     @import './tokens/spacing';
     @import './themes/default';
     ```

2. **Development Standards**: Define comprehensive coding standards

   - **Frontend Standards**: TypeScript and React patterns
     ```typescript
     // Component development standards
     interface ComponentProps {
       // Props interface with proper typing
     }
     
     export const Component: React.FC<ComponentProps> = ({ ...props }) => {
       // Implementation following shared patterns
     };
     ```
   
   - **Backend Standards**: Go development patterns for BFFs
     ```go
     // BFF structure with shared middleware
     package main
     
     import (
         "github.com/mod-arch/shared/auth"
         "github.com/mod-arch/shared/api"
     )
     
     func main() {
         r := gin.New()
         r.Use(auth.ValidateToken())
         r.Use(api.ErrorHandler())
     }
     ```
   
   - **Testing Standards**: Comprehensive testing approaches
     ```typescript
     // Testing patterns with shared utilities
     import { renderWithProviders, mockApiClient } from '@mod-arch/shared/testing';
     
     describe('Component', () => {
       it('should render correctly', () => {
         renderWithProviders(<Component />);
       });
     });
     ```

3. **CI/CD Pipeline**: Set up automated build and deployment

   - **Shared Library Pipeline**: Automated versioning and publishing
     ```yaml
     # .github/workflows/shared-library.yml
     name: Shared Library CI/CD
     on:
       push:
         branches: [main]
       pull_request:
         branches: [main]
     
     jobs:
       test-and-publish:
         runs-on: ubuntu-latest
         steps:
           - uses: actions/checkout@v3
           - name: Test shared library
             run: npm run test:ci
           - name: Build and publish
             run: npm run build && npm publish
     ```
   
   - **Module Pipeline Templates**: Standardized CI/CD for modules
     ```yaml
     # templates/module-ci.yml
     name: Module CI/CD Template
     jobs:
       build:
         steps:
           - name: Install shared library
             run: npm install @mod-arch/shared@latest

       const { data, loading, error } = useApi('/api/models');
       const { showSuccess, showError } = useNotifications();
       
       return (
         <Table
           data={data}
           loading={loading}
           error={error}
           columns={modelColumns}
