## Development Workflow

Our development workflow is designed around the **upstream-first** philosophy, ensuring that all reusable functionality is developed in upstream repositories before being integrated into downstream products.

## Core Philosophy: Upstream-First Development

### What is Upstream-First?

**Upstream-First** development means that all new, reusable feature logic must be developed and merged into upstream, platform-agnostic repositories before any work begins on downstream-specific integrations. This approach ensures:

- **Community Alignment**: All development aligns with broader open-source communities
- **Reusability**: Features are designed for reuse from the beginning
- **Quality**: Community review and feedback improve feature quality
- **Sustainability**: Reduces maintenance burden through shared responsibility

### Benefits of Upstream-First

- **Reduced Technical Debt**: Features are designed with reusability in mind
- **Community Engagement**: External contributors can participate in feature development
- **Quality Assurance**: Community review process improves code quality
- **Strategic Alignment**: Aligns development with industry standards and practices

## Development Modes

Our workflow supports three distinct development modes, each serving specific purposes in the development lifecycle:

### 1. Standalone Mode (Primary Development)

**Purpose**: Day-to-day feature development and testing

#### Environment Characteristics

- **Local Machine**: Development happens on developer's local machine
- **Mocked Authentication**: Uses header-based authentication (`kubeflow-user`)
- **No Infrastructure Dependencies**: No need for running Kubernetes clusters
- **Fast Iteration**: Maximum development speed with immediate feedback

#### Setup Process

```bash
# Clone the module repository
git clone https://github.com/kubeflow/model-registry
cd model-registry

# Install frontend dependencies
cd frontend
npm install

# Start the BFF in mock mode
cd ../backend
go run ./cmd/bff --mock-mode

# Start the frontend development server
cd ../frontend
npm start
```

#### Benefits

- **Maximum Development Speed**: No waiting for infrastructure setup
- **Isolated Development**: Work on features without external dependencies
- **Simplified Debugging**: Issues are isolated to the module being developed
- **Resource Efficiency**: Minimal resource requirements on developer machines

### 2. Kubeflow Mode (Integration Testing)

**Purpose**: Testing against real Kubeflow platform services

#### Kubeflow Environment Characteristics

- **Running Kubeflow Cluster**: Requires access to a Kubeflow installation
- **Real Authentication**: Uses Kubeflow's authentication system
- **Live Data**: Works with real platform data and services
- **High Fidelity**: Tests realistic integration scenarios

#### Kubeflow Setup Process

```bash
# Configure kubectl context
kubectl config use-context kubeflow-cluster

# Deploy module to cluster
kubectl apply -f manifests/

# Port forward for local development
kubectl port-forward svc/model-registry-bff 8080:80

# Configure frontend to use cluster BFF
export REACT_APP_BFF_URL=http://localhost:8080
npm start
```

#### Kubeflow Benefits

- **Real Integration Testing**: Validates against actual platform services
- **Data Validation**: Tests with real data structures and volumes
- **Performance Testing**: Evaluates performance under realistic conditions
- **End-to-End Validation**: Complete user journey testing

### 3. Federated Mode (Product Validation)

**Purpose**: Full product-level integration testing

#### Environment Characteristics

- **Complete Platform**: Full downstream platform (e.g., RHOAI) environment
- **Production-Like**: Mirrors production environment configuration
- **Host Authentication**: Uses platform's authentication system
- **Complete Integration**: All modules and features integrated

#### Setup Process

```bash
# Deploy to staging environment
helm upgrade --install platform-release ./charts \
  --values staging-values.yaml

# Run integration tests
npm run test:e2e:federated

# Validate user journeys
cypress run --spec "cypress/integration/federated/**/*"
```

#### Benefits

- **Production Validation**: Tests complete production scenarios
- **User Experience Validation**: Validates complete user experience
