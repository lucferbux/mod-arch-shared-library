# Modular Architecture Roadmap

This roadmap outlines our strategic plan for implementing modular architecture across the AI platform, with specific milestones, deliverables, and success criteria.

## Vision and Goals

### Primary Vision

Transform the AI platform development model from monolithic to modular, enabling independent teams to develop, deploy, and maintain features autonomously while maintaining consistency and quality across the entire platform.

### Strategic Goals

#### 1. Independent Team Enablement
- **Inverse Conway Maneuver**: Restructure teams to align with desired modular architecture
- **Autonomous Operations**: Teams can merge PRs, manage tests, and deploy features independently
- **Domain Ownership**: Clear ownership boundaries for different business domains

#### 2. Architectural Standardization
- **Micro-Frontend + BFF Pattern**: Standardize on proven architectural patterns
- **Golden Paths**: Establish clear, opinionated development paths
- **Shared Libraries**: Common UI and BFF libraries for consistency and reusability

#### 3. Cross-Platform Reusability
- **Universal Components**: Components work across RHOAI, upstream, Jupyter extensions, and Gen AI v3 UI
- **Platform Agnostic**: Features developed once, deployed everywhere
- **Upstream Integration**: Seamless consumption of upstream projects

## Current State Assessment

### Teams Currently Adopting Modular Architecture

#### ✅ **Model Registry (Green Team)**
- **Status**: Laboratory/pilot implementation complete
- **Architecture**: Standalone micro-frontend with BFF
- **Deployment**: Integrated into RHOAI dashboard
- **Next Steps**: Finalize deployment automation and documentation

#### 🔄 **Notebooks**
- **Status**: Modular architecture implemented, upstream only
- **Architecture**: Micro-frontend architecture
- **Next Steps**: Integration strategy for downstream consumption

#### 🚀 **Upcoming Teams**
