## Executive Summary

The **Modular Architecture Initiative** represents a fundamental shift in how we build and maintain our AI platform's user interface. Moving from a monolithic frontend application to a modular, micro-frontend based approach, this initiative addresses key challenges in scalability, maintainability, and developer productivity while enabling upstream-first development practices.

### Key Goals

- **Enable Upstream-First Development**: Align with open-source communities and facilitate external contributions
- **Improve Developer Experience**: Streamline development workflows and reduce time-to-market
- **Enhance Feature Reusability**: Allow components developed for one project to be easily integrated into others
- **Support Diverse Deployment Environments**: Enable flexible deployment across different platforms and contexts
- **Maintain Consistent User Experience**: Provide cohesive interfaces across all platform applications

---

## Current State and Challenges

### The Monolithic Reality

Our existing AI platform dashboard operates as a **monolithic application** with the following characteristics:

- **Frontend**: React-based application making direct calls to Kubernetes APIs
- **Backend**: Node.js proxy layer with minimal business logic
- **Architecture**: Centralized codebase with tightly coupled components
- **Deployment**: Single deployable unit containing all features

### Pain Points

This monolithic approach has created several challenges:

1. **Development Bottlenecks**: All teams must coordinate changes through a single codebase
2. **Limited Reusability**: Features developed for one context cannot be easily extracted and reused
3. **Deployment Complexity**: Any change requires redeploying the entire application
4. **Upstream Contribution Barriers**: Difficult for external contributors to participate in specific feature development
5. **Technology Lock-in**: Hard to experiment with new technologies or approaches for specific features
6. **Scalability Issues**: Growing codebase becomes increasingly difficult to maintain and navigate

## Introduction to Modular Architecture

### What is Modular Architecture?

**Modular Architecture** is a design approach that decomposes large applications into smaller, independent, and loosely coupled modules. In the context of frontend development, this translates to **micro-frontends** - independently deployable frontend applications that compose together to form a cohesive user experience.

### Core Philosophy

Our modular approach is built on three fundamental principles:

1. **Independence**: Each module can be developed, tested, and deployed independently
2. **Composition**: Modules combine to create a unified user experience
3. **Reusability**: Modules can be reused across different projects and contexts

### The Big Picture

## Core Architectural Patterns

Our modular architecture is built on three foundational patterns that work together to create a scalable and maintainable system:

### 1. Micro-Frontend Architecture

**Micro-frontends** are the building blocks of our new architecture. Each micro-frontend represents a distinct business domain or feature set.

#### Key Characteristics

- **Self-Contained**: Each micro-frontend is a complete web application with its own components, state management, and data-fetching logic
- **Domain-Focused**: Aligned with specific business capabilities (e.g., Model Registry, Experiment Tracking)
- **Technology Flexibility**: While we recommend standard technologies, teams can choose different approaches when justified
- **Independent Lifecycle**: Development, testing, and deployment happen independently

#### Examples of Micro-Frontends

- **Model Registry Module**: Manages model artifacts and metadata
- **Experiment Tracking Module**: Handles ML experiment lifecycle
- **Serving Dashboards Module**: Monitors and manages model serving infrastructure
- **Data Management Module**: Handles dataset operations and versioning

### 2. Backend-for-Frontend (BFF) Pattern

Each micro-frontend is supported by its own **Backend-for-Frontend (BFF)** - a dedicated server-side component tailored to the specific needs of its corresponding frontend.

#### Primary Functions

- **API Aggregation**: Combines data from multiple backend services into optimized frontend-specific APIs
- **Authentication Handling**: Manages authentication flows and token validation
- **Data Transformation**: Converts backend data formats into frontend-optimized structures
- **Business Logic**: Contains domain-specific logic that doesn't belong in the frontend
- **Caching and Performance**: Implements caching strategies to improve frontend performance

#### BFF Benefits

```text
Frontend ←→ BFF ←→ [K8s APIs | ML Services | Databases]
                ↑
            Single, optimized
            API surface for 
            the frontend
```

### 3. Shared UI Essentials Library

The **Shared UI Essentials Library** is the cornerstone of consistency and reusability across all modules.

#### Frontend Assets

- **React Components**: Common UI components following design system guidelines
- **Custom Hooks**: Reusable logic for data fetching, state management, and side effects
- **Shared Contexts**: Application-wide state management (user info, theming, notifications)
- **Style Library**: Consistent styling, themes, and design tokens
- **Utility Functions**: Common helper functions and type definitions

#### Backend Assets

- **Authentication Middleware**: Common auth patterns for BFF implementations
- **Logging and Monitoring**: Standardized observability patterns
- **API Utilities**: Common patterns for API validation and error handling
- **Database Abstractions**: Shared patterns for data access

---

## Implementation Approaches

We support multiple implementation strategies to accommodate different deployment scenarios and organizational needs:

### 1. Standalone Micro-Frontend Approach

**Best for**: New features, upstream-first development, and independent deployment scenarios.

#### Key Features

- Each feature is developed as a completely independent application
- Has its own repository, deployment pipeline, and release cycle
- Can be consumed by multiple host applications
- Follows strict upstream-first development practices

#### Example: Model Registry

```text
Repository: kubeflow/model-registry
├── frontend/        # React micro-frontend
├── backend/         # Golang BFF
├── manifests/       # K8s deployment configs
└── docs/           # Feature-specific documentation
```

### 2. Module Federation Approach

**Best for**: Existing applications that need to gradually adopt modular patterns.

#### Module Federation Features

- Uses Webpack Module Federation for runtime composition
- Enables dynamic loading of micro-frontends
- Supports gradual migration from monolithic to modular
- Maintains single deployment while enabling module independence

#### Implementation Structure

```text
Host Application (Dashboard)
├── Core shell and routing
├── Shared dependencies management
└── Dynamic module loading

Remote Modules
├── Model Registry Module (@mf/modelRegistry)
├── KServe Module (@odh-dashboard/kserve)
└── Model Serving Module (@odh-dashboard/model-serving)
```

### 3. Hybrid Approach

**Best for**: Organizations with mixed requirements and legacy constraints.

#### Hybrid Features

- Combines both standalone and federated approaches
- Allows for flexible migration strategies
- Supports different team preferences and technical constraints
- Enables experimentation with different patterns
