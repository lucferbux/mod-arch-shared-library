# Modular Architecture Documentation

Welcome to the comprehensive documentation for our Modular Architecture Initiative - a transformative approach to building scalable, reusable, and maintainable AI platform interfaces.

## Introduction

The Modular Architecture Initiative represents a fundamental shift from monolithic frontend applications to a modular, micro-frontend based approach. This initiative addresses key challenges in scalability, maintainability, and developer productivity while enabling upstream-first development practices.

### Key Benefits

- **üöÄ Accelerated Development**: Independent development and deployment of features
- **üîÑ Enhanced Reusability**: Components can be shared across multiple projects
- **üåê Upstream-First Approach**: Aligns with open-source communities and best practices
- **üìà Improved Scalability**: Modular architecture supports platform growth
- **üë• Better Developer Experience**: Streamlined workflows and reduced complexity

## Development Scenarios

### Golden Path Scenarios

Choose your development path based on your team's needs:

- **New RHOAI Feature**: [Golden Path - New RHOAI Feature](./golden-path.md#we-are-a-team-that-wants-to-develop-a-new-rhoai-feature)
- **Migrate RHOAI Feature**: [Golden Path - Migration](./golden-path.md#we-are-a-team-that-wants-to-migrate-a-feature-already-in-rhoai-to-modular-architecture)
- **New Kubeflow Feature**: [Golden Path - Kubeflow](./golden-path.md#we-are-a-team-that-wants-to-develop-a-new-feature-into-kubeflow-work-in-progress) *(Work in Progress)*
- **Migrate to Kubeflow**: [Golden Path - Kubeflow Migration](./golden-path.md#we-are-a-team-that-wants-to-migrate-a-feature-into-kubeflow-work-in-progress) *(Work in Progress)*

### Development Approaches

- **Federated Development**: For ODH/RHOAI teams using monorepo structure with Module Federation
- **Upstream Development**: For Kubeflow contributions using standalone mode
- **Downstream Development**: For enterprise-specific features in ODH/RHOAI
