# Architecture Overview

This document introduces the fundamental concepts and principles of our modular architecture approach.

## What is Modular Architecture?

**Modular Architecture** is a design approach that decomposes large applications into smaller, independent, and loosely coupled modules. In the context of frontend development, this translates to **micro-frontends** - independently deployable frontend applications that compose together to form a cohesive user experience.

## Core Philosophy

Our modular approach is built on three fundamental principles:

### 1. Independence

Each module can be developed, tested, and deployed independently. This independence enables:

- **Autonomous Development**: Teams can work at their own pace without coordination overhead
- **Technology Flexibility**: Modules can adopt different technologies when appropriate
- **Risk Isolation**: Issues in one module don't affect others
- **Focused Expertise**: Teams can specialize in specific domains

### 2. Composition

Modules combine to create a unified user experience. This composition provides:

- **Seamless Integration**: Users experience a single, cohesive application
- **Flexible Deployment**: Different module combinations for different environments
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Core functionality with optional advanced features
- **Runtime Flexibility**: Dynamic loading and configuration of modules

### 3. Reusability

Modules can be reused across different projects and contexts. This reusability delivers:

- **Development Efficiency**: Build once, use everywhere
- **Consistency**: Common patterns and behaviors across applications
- **Reduced Duplication**: Shared components eliminate redundant development
- **Community Benefits**: Modules can be shared with the broader ecosystem

## Key Architectural Concepts

### Domain-Driven Design

Our modules are organized around business domains rather than technical layers:

- **Model Registry Module**: Manages model artifacts and metadata
- **Experiment Tracking Module**: Handles ML experiment lifecycle
- **Serving Dashboards Module**: Monitors and manages model serving infrastructure
- **Data Management Module**: Handles dataset operations and versioning

### Vertical Slice Architecture

Each module represents a complete vertical slice of functionality:

- **Frontend Components**: User interface elements and interactions
- **Backend-for-Frontend (BFF)**: Domain-specific API layer
- **Business Logic**: Domain rules and workflows
- **Data Access**: Integration with underlying services and APIs

### Shared Foundation

Common functionality is provided through shared libraries:

- **UI Components**: Reusable interface elements
- **Design System**: Consistent styling and theming
- **Utilities**: Common helper functions and patterns
- **Infrastructure**: Shared development and deployment tools

## Architectural Benefits

### For Development

- **Faster Iteration**: Smaller, focused codebases enable quicker development cycles
- **Parallel Development**: Multiple teams can work simultaneously without conflicts
- **Technology Innovation**: Modules can experiment with new approaches independently
- **Easier Testing**: Isolated modules are easier to test comprehensively

### For Deployment

- **Independent Releases**: Deploy features when they're ready, not when everything is ready
- **Reduced Risk**: Smaller deployment units minimize blast radius of issues
- **Scalable Infrastructure**: Modules can be scaled independently based on demand
- **Environment Flexibility**: Different module combinations for different environments

### For Maintenance

- **Focused Expertise**: Teams can specialize in specific domains
- **Isolated Changes**: Modifications in one module don't affect others
- **Gradual Migration**: Legacy features can be migrated incrementally
- **Clear Boundaries**: Well-defined interfaces between modules

## Design Principles

### 1. Loose Coupling

Modules interact through well-defined interfaces, minimizing dependencies:

- **API Contracts**: Clear, versioned interfaces between modules
- **Event-Driven Communication**: Modules communicate through events rather than direct calls
- **Shared State Minimization**: Each module manages its own state independently
- **Interface Abstraction**: Modules depend on abstractions, not concrete implementations

### 2. High Cohesion

Related functionality is grouped together within modules:

- **Single Responsibility**: Each module has a clear, focused purpose
- **Domain Boundaries**: Modules align with business domain boundaries
- **Feature Completeness**: Modules contain all functionality needed for their domain
- **Internal Consistency**: Module internals follow consistent patterns and conventions

### 3. Explicit Dependencies

All module dependencies are clearly defined and managed:

- **Dependency Injection**: External dependencies are provided to modules
- **Version Management**: Shared dependencies are versioned and managed centrally
- **Interface Contracts**: Dependencies are defined through explicit interfaces
- **Runtime Discovery**: Modules can discover and use available services dynamically

## Implementation Patterns

Our modular architecture employs several key patterns:

### Micro-Frontend Pattern

- Independent frontend applications that compose into a unified experience
- Each module owns its complete user interface
- Runtime composition through module federation or iframe integration
- Shared dependencies managed at the host application level

### Backend-for-Frontend (BFF) Pattern

- Each frontend module has its own dedicated backend component
- BFF provides an optimized API specifically for its frontend
- Handles data aggregation, transformation, and business logic
- Abstracts underlying service complexity from the frontend

### Shared Library Pattern

- Common functionality extracted into reusable libraries
- Shared components, utilities, and patterns
- Centralized version management and distribution
- Consistent development and runtime experience

## Conclusion

The modular architecture provides a foundation for sustainable, scalable development that aligns with our strategic goals of upstream-first development, community engagement, and platform growth. By embracing independence, composition, and reusability, we create systems that can evolve with our needs while maintaining consistency and quality.
